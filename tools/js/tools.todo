See if we can append to existing JSON
clean up "new" divs as well with CSS 

Figure out where in the JSON the new itemS --plural-- need to be added, then add them. 
	Network wise this is better to do in the PHP, but may be easier to do in the JSON
		(basically how do we build this object before we JSONify it)
