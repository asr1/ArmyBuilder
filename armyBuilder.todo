Make ProcessUpload build the army
In upload, make sure that Models has an element -- if it says ModelName: [], It has been removed
	This is true for many areas -- might be irrelevant, actually. Due to json conversion, can probaly ignore
gear will be processed from the Models section, as will powers
Consider changing From null null true to actual numbers for addons.
not sure we know on upload if we have addons checked, only that the gear changed.
need to ensure the UI disabled elements are correct (for units already added) after upload
