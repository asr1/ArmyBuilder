# Army Builder

An army builder for miniatures game. Right now, it only supports Warhammer 40k 8th edition.
Today, the only supported units are those included in the Dark Imperium starter box.
More troops and more systems may be added in the future.

## Getting Started

You should be able to clone this and use it immediately on any classic server (including localhost).

### Prerequisites

This army builder depends on AngularJs (1.6.4) and JQuery, both of which are included as CDNs out of the box.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome!
