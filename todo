TODO:
17. More CSS Formatting
18. Add support for psykers and their abilities (including has and has x from: [so I can say has #1, has 2 from #5, 6, 7]).
19. Need support for model-level abilities and unit-level
25. Bug where adding a unit, adding troops to it, then removing it and adding again modifies the default value. Need to store original or reload?
22. Save/load favorite armies?
\#23. Plague marines don't have gear (see 21)
\#21. Need a way for different models to have different gear at creation (Plague Marines)
\#24. Gear is broken for many people (try lord of contagion)
\#23 When adding a new unit, if Separate Gear, give DefaultGear
\#20. Need some way of mut-exing add-ons (plague marines)
\#4. Add the rest of the data
\#1. CSS formatting
\#16. Adding a unit that has been already added adds a new model to that unit. Should instead do nothing. 
\#3. Display multiple troops if I have more than 1 (maybe remove the # dropdown and change the behavior where if they're already in the array, append a 2 to the name? this would also allow two troops with different loadouts). Do this, and track NumToAppend by the id.
\#2. Get total cost of army -- IN PROGRESS (done except for #3, below). Right now # is hardcoded to 1.
\#3.5 Related to 3, add support for multiple troops within a unit -- I think we actually need to have gear, addons on a *unit* level, repeated for each infantry in the unit. 
\#3.75 related, fix bug where adding replace item applies to the whole unit. Should only apply to one model.
\#	Possibly can track with $index?
\#		Especially if we have a function to calculate, we can do caching like we do.
\#11. Unit cost needs to take into consideration model gear.
\#12. IncreaseModelNUm() doesn't work correctly
\#13. related to 11, calculateUnitCost doesn't work correctly 
\#14. TotalCost is NAN
\#8. Pull out replace gear function
\#9. Lieutenant -> do I make the choice for weapons per model or per unit? -- Per model
\#10. Change to calculate addon Cost -- instead of hardcoding, if it's remove, have the cost be add - remove. Replace the {{cost}} with CalculateCost() that has a switch like ApplyAddon
\#5. Connect addOns to the cost of a troop
\#6. we can give the addons a type!
\#Direct: just add the points, it's text
\#ReplaceItem: also takes a Remove and an Add paramter. If checked, replace. If unchecked, inverse.
\#Increase ModelNum: by amount.
\#and DON'T increase the cost if not direct
\#7. Unitcount is not multiplying by modelcount
